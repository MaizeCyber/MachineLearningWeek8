    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of the machine learning model is classification. We want to determine which connections a firewall should allow, deny, drop, or \"reset-both.\" Automating the classification of firewall rules is beneficial because many features of network traffic, such as bytes sent, are continuous rather than discrete, making set threshold values difficult to set. In addition, malicious or unwanted traffic likely cannot be identified by just one factor. For example, traffic over a certain port may normally be benign, but high volume could indicate malicious activity. Finally, machine learning can help identify trends and patterns that are too difficult for humans to identify manually, but emerge given enough training data.\n",

Only on of the features, Class, is categorical. These are the target values we will use to train the model for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin train a model for classification, we have to convert the string classes into numbers that sklearn can process. To do this we use sklearn's LabelEncoder to preprocess the classes. We pass the column of the class to the method fit_transform. This creates an object containing our target values converted to integers and ready for training. We can still view the associated strings with by printing \"le.classes_\"."
